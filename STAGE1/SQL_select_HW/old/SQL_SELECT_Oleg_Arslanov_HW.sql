--Part 1: Write SQL queries to retrieve the following data

--1) All animation movies released between 2017 and 2019 with rate(rental_rate) more than 1, alphabetical

select *

where release_year >= 2017 
	and release_year <= 2019 
	and f.rental_rate > 1
order by title asc;

select *
from film

--2) The revenue earned by each rental store since March 2017 (columns: address and address2 â€“ as one column, revenue)

--5) For each client, display a list of horrors that he had ever rented (in one column, separated by commas), and the amount of money that he paid for it

--Part 2: Solve the following problems using SQL

--1. Which three employees generated the most revenue in 2017? They should be awarded a bonus for their outstanding performance. 
--Assumptions: 
--staff could work in several stores in a year, please indicate which store the staff worked in (the last one);
--if staff processed the payment then he works in the same store; 
--take into account only payment_date

--- there is two CTE, then I joined them
with staff_revenue as (
	select p.staff_id, SUM(amount) as total_revenue
	from staff s 
	join payment p on p.staff_id = s.staff_id 
	join store stor on stor.store_id = s.store_id

	where extract(year from payment_date) = 2017
	group by s.staff_id, stor.store_id)
select sr.staff_id, total_revenue, last_store
from staff_revenue sr
join last_staff_store lss on sr.staff_id = lss.staff_id
order by total_revenue desc
limit 3;

-- there I can aggregate by one CTE, because I can group by the same attributes

from staff_revenue
order by total_revenue desc

--2. Which 5 movies were rented more than others (number of rentals), and what's the expected age of the audience for these movies? 
--To determine expected age please use 'Motion Picture Association film rating system'

with film_count as (
select f.title, count(rental_id) as count_max

--Part 3. Which actors/actresses didn't act for a longer period of time than the others? 

--The task can be interpreted in various ways, and here are a few options:
--V1: gap between the latest release_year and current year per each actor;
--V2: gaps between sequential films per each actor;

--It would be plus if you could provide a solution for each interpretation

--V1 version. We can and need join actor, film and film_actor tables, because we need operate with attributes from this tables. From them we need actors name, surname and films releases, where actor played. 
--Count gap between extract(year from current_date) and last release_year, where actor played. And then we only need order by asc

--V2 version. I use CTE for clear view. I made two table: release_year and lag_release_table. Those table are connected twice by actor_id and release_year.
-- Function LAG automaticly always taking previous value of release year of film, where actor filmed (so we need that connection release year). 
--So then we need to connect tables, select MAX period grouping by name, surname. And miracle thats it :)
